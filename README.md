# Pollz4Teamz
My final capstone project during BrainStation

##
For the backend, you need to have: Nodejs, Express and Socket.io installed
For the frontend, you need: React, React Router, Socket-io client, React-Alerts and Boostrap

####
This is a polling app that uses sockets to communicate data between the server and client. It provides a UI where
team leaders could quickly poll fellow employees on a specific issue.

Key features:

1. User connects and name is registered.
2. Status of connection is sent from the server and actively displayed on page
3. Amount of connected members are logged to page, so a potential manager would know how many employees have 
â‹…accessed the survey
4. Once completed, the results of the poll are graphed onto a chart.
5. There is an error-handling route in case a user navigates to the wrong page.
